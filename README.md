### Structure

- `/sim_anneal` - Code for performing <i>Simulated Annealing (SA)</i>, this is the popular classical algorithm. 
- `/sim_quantum_anneal` - Code for performing <i>Simulated Quantum Annealing (SQA)</i>, attempting to sample from the ground state of our problem hamiltonian using Trotter slices.
- `/experiment` - A sub-library for executing experiments over multiple CPU cores

### Setup
- Create a virtual environment
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
